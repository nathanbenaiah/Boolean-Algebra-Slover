## 👨‍💻 About Me

**Benaiah Nicholas Nimal**  
17-year-old ICT student at St. John's College, Jaffna

I created this tool to help students like myself learn Boolean algebra and digital logic concepts more effectively. As someone who struggled with these concepts initially, I wanted to build a free, accessible solution that makes learning interactive and fun.
